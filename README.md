# Keypad-Input-Display-on-LCD-Using-PIC-Microcontroller
This project demonstrates how to interface a 4x4 keypad with a PIC microcontroller and display the pressed numbers on an LCD. The code is written in Embedded C using MPLAB IDE, and the simulation is done in Proteus. It helps in understanding keypad scanning and LCD interfacing with PIC microcontrollers.
# Features
Detects key presses from a 4x4 matrix keypad.
Displays the pressed numbers on a 16x2 LCD.
Efficient keypad scanning and real-time LCD updates.
# Tools Used
Microcontroller: PIC, 
Programming Language: Embedded C, 
IDE: MPLAB IDE, 
Simulation Software: Proteus
# How It Works
The keypad is connected to the microcontroller using GPIO pins.
When a key is pressed, the microcontroller scans and identifies the key.
The corresponding number is displayed on the LCD in real time.
