# Keypad-Input-Display-on-LCD-Using-PIC-Microcontroller
This project demonstrates how to interface a 4x4 keypad with a PIC microcontroller and display the pressed numbers on an LCD. The code is written in Embedded C using MPLAB IDE, and the simulation is done in Proteus. It helps in understanding keypad scanning and LCD interfacing with PIC microcontrollers.
